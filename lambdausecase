Spinning up a Lambda function along with required Network components	
"1. Use existing VPC
2. Use existing subnets (public & private) attached with the default VPC
3. Create an IAM role (with permissions to access S3 & Dynamo DB)
4. Create a new Security Group having inbound traffic from Bastion host
5. Create a lambda function and place it within the private/application subnet ""subnet-0370e4a97c3cc02a8"".
6. Attach the IAM role to the lambda function
7. Attach the SG of EC2 instance with the Lambda function"	
"1. Use VPC ""vpc-03941e18a3dde38d2""
2. IAM role with least privileges (only allowed for S3 & Dynamo DB).
3. Lambda function CPU utilization should be minimal (256), with runtime as python version 3.9
4. Timeout should be 5 mins (maximum)

*Region eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)"


IAM Role Policy Update:
ec2:CreateNetworkInterface, ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces, and ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface: These permissions are added to allow the Lambda function to create and manage network interfaces within the VPC.
